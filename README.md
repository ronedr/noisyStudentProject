The Article we chose: "Self-training with noisy student improves image net classification".

In this project, we ran experiment on three algorithms in order to show the improvements we compare them on 20 datasets, on the metrics of Accuracy, TPR, FPR, Precision, AUC, Area under the Precision-Recall, training time, Inference time for 1000 instances.
